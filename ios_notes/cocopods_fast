Cocopods seems to keep all the different packages in a single master repo and this causes
extremely slow speeds when trying to download the master repo.

The master repo has to be downloaded the first time you start using cocoapods and it is SLOW 

A tip to speed up the install. 
Rather than making cocoapods terminal tool download the repo on its own, 
download the repo manually. 

This is because when we download a repo manually, we can choose to use ssh instead of https 
and this ends up being faster. I am not sure why. 

[ Github maintains something like 5 servers for serving the cocoapods lib, may be when we use ssh, 
we hit servers which are under a lower load may be ? ]

Anyways it can be done like this 
:

pod repo remove master
git clone git@github.com:CocoaPods/Specs.git ~/.cocoapods/repos/master
pod setup
