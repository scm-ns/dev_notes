In gcc-toolchain the preprocessor uses the headers locations specified by the -I tag to create the final file which will be used for compilation
In xcode there is a framework serach path that must be used if the frameworks is not included within the project, like copied or something. 
Also note that if you copy the framework into the project, then the preprocess will run okay, but if you are linking aganist a frameowkr in a different dir, 
then use the framework search path if you want the preprocessor to run properly. 

Also we aware of includeing within targets !
