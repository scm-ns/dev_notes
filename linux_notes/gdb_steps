How to sep break points : 
    b test.cpp:156
        where test.cpp is the file name and 156 is the line number
    b class_name::function_name
        break at a specific function in a specific class
    
    c 
        continues the program after the breaking point
        till it hits the next break point

    p / d
        Displays the variable
    
    s 
        Goes to the next line of code. And stops execution there. 

    n   
        Goes to the next function and stops execution there. 
        So it is simialr to s, but rather than stopping at the next 
        line of code. It stops at the next function call, at the same 
        stack level.

Bug Finding general Tips :

GDB allows us to manage multiple threads. 
    It can be seen using 
    info threads 
    
    # This will allow the context to be switched into a particular thread. 
    thread #thread-number 
    
    thread apply all #command

GDB can't seem to run just a sinlge thread. When you run it, it runs all the different threads
    together.
